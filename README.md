# Machine Learning
 Machine learning project created in Python
 
# Description

## Project created for Machine Learning where four different classifier algorithms were implemented to accurately determine the salary bracket of a professional basketball player.

# Data

## The data was taken from publicly available statistics on professional basketball players. Selected data was imported into Excel, normalized, and then exported into an easily readable format for our Python files.

#### Instructions
To run the naive bayes and svm classifier codes and test for accuracy, 
unzip the FinalNBSVM.zip file and run as a project ideally in pycharm.

In main, comment out the code to get the confusion matrix and heat matrix at the bottom.
you only need the print(accuracy(Y_test, y_pred) line at the bottom.

Run main.py for the naive bayes and svm.py for the svm.
