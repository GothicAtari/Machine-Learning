README - COMP5630 Final Project 
To run the naive bayes and svm classifier codes and test for accuracy, 
unzip the FinalNBSVM.zip file and run as a project ideally in pycharm.

In main, comment out the code to get the confusion matrix and heat matrix at the bottom.
you only need the print(accuracy(Y_test, y_pred) line at the bottom.

Run main.py for the naive bayes and svm.py for the svm.
